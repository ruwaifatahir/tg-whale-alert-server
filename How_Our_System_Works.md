# How Our Whale Alert System Works

## What It Does

Our system automatically finds and alerts you when "whales" (big investors) buy cryptocurrency tokens that you're tracking.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **We Monitor Your Groups**

- The system checks all active Telegram groups you've set up
- Each group is watching a specific cryptocurrency token

### 2. **We Look for Big Purchases**

- Every few minutes, we scan for recent buy transactions of your tracked tokens
- We only care about purchases above your minimum dollar amount (you set this)

### 3. **We Check the Buyer's Background**

- For each big purchase, we investigate who made the buy
- We look at their trading history and wallet contents
- We calculate their success rate and trading patterns

### 4. **We Create Smart Alerts**

- If the buyer looks like a successful "whale" investor, we create an alert
- The alert includes:
  - How much they bought
  - What token they bought
  - Their trading success rate
  - Their wallet statistics
  - Links to your project's social media

### 5. **We Send Notifications**

- The alert gets posted to your Telegram group automatically
- We include any images or media you've set up
- We make sure not to send duplicate alerts

### 6. **We Keep Track**

- Every alert is saved in our database
- This prevents spam and helps us avoid sending the same alert twice

## Why This Helps You

- **Save Time**: No need to manually watch transactions
- **Catch Opportunities**: Get notified immediately when whales are buying
- **Build Confidence**: Share proof that smart money is investing in your token
- **Stay Informed**: Keep your community updated with relevant whale activity

## Simple Summary

Think of it as having a smart assistant that watches the crypto market 24/7, spots when successful investors buy your token, and immediately tells your community about it with all the important details.
